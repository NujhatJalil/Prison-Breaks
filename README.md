# Helicopter-Assisted Prison Breaks: A Data-Driven Analysis of Frequency, Success Rates, and Participant Dynamics Over Decades
This was my first data science project; an analysis of data on helicopter prison breaks up to 2020 which I did a few years ago and did not think to upload here. :P
It is yet unfinished! As with most of my endeavors, I plan to return to it to delve deeper into the data than I originally did when I was but a young Padawan. Scroll all the way down on the Jupyter file to see some ideas I've got for what I'll do with this in the future!
